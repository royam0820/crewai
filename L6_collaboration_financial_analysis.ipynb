Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

I will now use this information to develop a trading strategy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Final Answer: Based on the technical analysis from TipRanks, here is a potential day trading strategy for AAPL:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Entry Points**:\n",
            "   - **Buy**: Initiate a buy position when AAPL's price is above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $180.00, as it currently stands at $189.87. This indicates a bullish trend.\n",
            "   - **Sell for Short**: Consider entering a short position if the price falls below the 20-day EMA, especially if accompanied by high trading volume and bearish market sentiment.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Exit Points**:\n",
            "   - **Take Profit**: Set a take-profit level near the next resistance point, which can be identified using the pivot points provided. For instance, if entering around $189.87, aim for a target near the R1 pivot point at $191.12 or higher.\n",
            "   - **Stop Loss**: Place a stop-loss order slightly below the nearest key support level to mitigate risk. For example, setting a stop-loss around $187.84 (S1 pivot point) could be advisable.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Indicators to Watch**:\n",
            "   - **MACD**: Monitor the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for potential sell signals. The current MACD at 4.65 suggests caution, as it indicates a potential sell.\n",
            "   - **RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 71.40 also points to AAPL potentially being overbought, which might signal a forthcoming price correction or reversal.\n",
            "   - **CCI**: Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at 109.36 is another indicator suggesting a potential sell due to overbought conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Risk Management**:\n",
            "   - Adjust the size of the trading positions based on the user's risk tolerance. For a conservative approach, smaller positions with tighter stop-loss orders may be preferable.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Entry Points**:\n",
            "   - **Buy**: Initiate a buy position when AAPL's price is above its 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of $180.00, as it currently stands at $189.87. This indicates a bullish trend.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Exit Points**:\n",
            "   - **Take Profit**: Set a take-profit level near the next resistance point, which can be identified using the pivot points provided. For instance, if entering around $189.87, aim for a target near the R1 pivot point at $191.12 or higher.\n",
            "   - **Stop Loss**: Place a stop-loss order slightly below the nearest key support level to mitigate risk. For example, setting a stop-loss around $187.84 (S1 pivot point) could be advisable.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Indicators to Watch**:\n",
            "   - **MACD**: Monitor the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for potential sell signals. The current MACD at 4.65 suggests caution, as it indicates a potential sell.\n",
            "   - **RSI**: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 71.40 also points to AAPL potentially being overbought, which might signal a forthcoming price correction or reversal.\n",
            "   - **CCI**: Commodity Channel Index (CCI) at 109.36 is another indicator suggesting a potential sell due to overbought conditions.\n",
