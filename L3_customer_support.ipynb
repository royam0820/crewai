            "text/markdown": "Dear Andrew Ng,\n\nThank you for reaching out for assistance with setting up a Crew and adding memory to it for DeepLearningAI. Below is a detailed guide on how to achieve this using the CrewAI framework:\n\nStep 1: Assemble Your Agents\n- Define your agents with distinct roles, backstories, and enhanced capabilities like verbose mode and memory usage. This adds depth and guides their task execution and interaction within the crew.\n\nExample code snippet:\n```\nfrom crewai import Agent\nfrom crewai_tools import SerperDevTool\n\n# Creating a senior researcher agent with memory and verbose mode\nresearcher = Agent(\n role='Senior Researcher',\n goal='Uncover groundbreaking technologies in {topic}',\n verbose=True,\n memory=True,\n backstory=(\n \"Driven by curiosity, you're at the forefront of innovation, eager to explore and share knowledge that could change the world.\"\n ),\n tools=[search_tool],\n allow_delegation=True\n)\n```\n\nStep 2: Define the Tasks\n- Detail specific objectives for your agents, including new features for asynchronous execution and output customization. These tasks ensure a targeted approach to their roles.\n\nExample code snippet:\n```\nfrom crewai import Task\n\n# Research task\nresearch_task = Task(\n description=(\n \"Identify the next big trend in {topic}. Focus on identifying pros and cons and the overall narrative. Your final report should clearly articulate the key points, its market opportunities, and potential risks.\"\n ),\n expected_output='A comprehensive 3 paragraphs long report on the latest AI trends.',\n tools=[search_tool],\n agent=researcher,\n)\n```\n\nStep 3: Form the Crew\n- Combine your agents into a crew, setting the workflow process they'll follow to accomplish the tasks. Configure language models for enhanced interaction and optimize performance.\n\nExample code snippet:\n```\nfrom crewai import Crew, Process\n\n# Forming the tech-focused crew with some enhanced configurations\ncrew = Crew(\n agents=[researcher, writer],\n tasks=[research_task, write_task],\n process=Process.sequential,\n memory=True,\n cache=True,\n max_rpm=100,\n share_crew=True\n)\n```\n\nStep 4: Kick It Off\n- Initiate the process with your enhanced crew ready. Collaborate and observe as your agents leverage their new capabilities for a successful project outcome.\n\nExample code snippet:\n```\n# Starting the task execution process with enhanced feedback\nresult = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'AI in healthcare'})\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn conclusion, by incorporating verbose mode, memory capabilities, asynchronous task execution, output customization, language model configuration, and enhanced crew configurations, your AI team in CrewAI is more equipped than ever to tackle challenges efficiently. The depth of agent backstories and the precision of their objectives enrich collaboration, leading to successful project outcomes.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please feel free to reach out. Good luck with setting up your Crew and kicking off your project!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nSenior Support Representative\ncrewAI"
